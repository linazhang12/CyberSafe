        <br>
        <p class="buddy">In order to maximize the learning experience, we ask that if the participant of CyberSafe is under the age of 13 years of age that they are accompanied by an adult supervisor (which will be referred to as a “cyber buddy” throughout the game).</p>
        <p class="buddy">As a an adult / under-13 participant pair (or cyber buddies), you will walk through the game together. As the older cyber buddy, it will be your responsibility to facilitate answering questions, watching videos, and completing tasks. While the game experience and curriculum is tailored to a participant under the age of 13, it is designed to be completed alongside an adult supervisor.</p>
        <p class="buddy">Some of the responsibilities of an adult cyber buddy include:</p>
        <div style="display:flex; justify-content: center;">
            <ul>
                <li>Following up after each lesson with your younger cyber buddy to ensure comprehension</li>
                <li>Clarifying terms and cybersecurity and online safety lingo that your younger cyber buddy may not know</li>
                <li>Creating a positive learning environment for your younger cyber buddy and keeping them on task</li>
                <li>Reflecting on the lessons in areas and topics that were unclear upon completion of the game</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <p class="buddy">If you agree to all the terms of participating as an adult supervisor above, click the button below to continue.</p>
